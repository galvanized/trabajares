# trabajares
TSA VEX robot 2017

Trabajares is a u-frame robot with four mechanum wheels in a parallel arrangement, topped by a arm with gripper.
It is intended to have climbing capabilities, also incorporating a winch.

Code is currently for driver control only. As trabajares lacks any sensors whatsoever, its autonomous potential is severely limited.
